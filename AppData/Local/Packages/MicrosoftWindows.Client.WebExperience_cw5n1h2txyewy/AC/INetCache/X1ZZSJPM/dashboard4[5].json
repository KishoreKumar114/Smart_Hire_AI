The report contextualises this event with other recent cases in Jaipur and Delhi, highlighting a distressing trend. According to the report, 'the priority remains to ensure another bright mind is not lost to suicide'. It cites National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data, which shows student suicides increased from 8,423 in 2013 to 13,892 in 2023, a rise of about 65% in a decade.
