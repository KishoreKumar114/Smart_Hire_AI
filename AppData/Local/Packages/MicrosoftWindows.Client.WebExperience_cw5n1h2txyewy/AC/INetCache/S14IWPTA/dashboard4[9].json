Experts say the shift corrects decades of underestimation of the central Himalayan segment, where locked faults continue accumulating stress powerful enough to generate a massive surface-rupturing earthquake. Using global PSHA standards, the updated Earthquake Design Code integrates active faults, maximum magnitudes, soil behaviour, near-fault motion and exposure-based vulnerability. As a result, 61% of India’s land is now officially under moderate to high seismic hazard. The fresh norms introduce strict requirements for buildings, focusing for the first time on non-structural failures that often cause injuries. Critical infrastructure must stay operational even after severe shaking. This map is a blueprint for survival, forcing India to confront its most dangerous natural threat.","readTimeMin":0,"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-in/news/india/india-s-updated-quake-map-warns-entire-himalayan-arc-faces-major-risk-forcing-urgent-safety-reforms/vi-AA1RkSrA","locale":"en-in","isLocalContent":false,"publishedDateTime":"2025-11-28T18:29:35Z","height":304.0,"wpoId":8,"isFeatured":false,"images":[{"width":690,"height":388,"url":"https://th.bing.com/th?id=ORMS.5cc0b7e9fe9402fadfe1948bb2324178&pid=Wdp","attribution":"","title":"India's Updated Quake Map Warns Entire Himalayan Arc Faces Major Risk, Forcing Urgent Safety Reforms","source":"msn"}],"provider":{"id":"BB18SBt9","name":"The Times of India","logoUrl":"https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AA1QEFsX.img","mainLogoUrl":"https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AA1QEFsX.img","promotionalUrl":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/","profileId":"vid-kbj0e8i25kw4rtyjnabhmqmgsb6cp3yrabg6maw0twupb7s29gga","lightThemeSVGLogo":{"width":0,"height":0,"url":""},"darkThemeSVGLogo":{"width":0,"height":0,"url":""},"feedAllowedFreeItem":0},"category":"news","reactionSummary":{"totalCount":257,"subReactionSummaries":[{"totalCount":217,"type":"upvote"},{"totalCount":40,"type":"downvote"}]},"reactionStatus":"on","commentSummary":{"totalCount":0},"commentStatus":"on","recoDocMetadata":{"ModelScore":"1.2312929564828323E-09","IsAtfHighQualityContent":"1"},"cardRankingMetadata":{"pClick":0.0,"pRelevance":0.0,"additionalNumericProperties":{},"additionalProperties":{}},"feed":{"feedName":"news","lastFreActionTimestamp":0,"feedCompositionCategory":"7|13"},"cardId":11,"reasons":[{"type":"trending","rank":0}],"ri":"508","recoId":"a506714a-a727-4088-8742-05e3222222e4","newsClusterIdV5":"943786268","newsClusterIdV6":"-43101756","source":"msn","videoMetadata":{"playTime":289,"closedCaptions":[{"locale":"en-in","href":"https://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AA1RkSrA?blobrefkey=closedcaptionen-in&$blob=1"}]},"externalVideoFiles":[{"url":"https://prod-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/v1/eus002/7ce3c099-25c5-483d-b82f-f265aef81e03/34a586c3-766e-40ac-8d9f-6d8cb6ff670a.mp4","width":1920,"height":1080,"contentType":"video/mp4","fileSize":96101319},{"url":"https://prod-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/v1/eus002/faeefb2c-8afe-45f9-bf69-1e9f8c353ed0/b2b46518-b295-4199-b02f-f0f8a341e9e3.m3u8","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"https://prod-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/v1/eus002/faeefb2c-8afe-45f9-bf69-1e9f8c353ed0/b2b46518-b295-4199-b02f-f0f8a341e9e3.m3u8","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"https://prod-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/v1/eus002/faeefb2c-8afe-45f9-bf69-1e9f8c353ed0/b2b46518-b295-4199-b02f-f0f8a341e9e3.mpd","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"https://prod-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/v1/eus002/faeefb2c-8afe-45f9-bf69-1e9f8c353ed0/b2b46518-b295-4199-b02f-f0f8a341e9e3_6750.mp4","width":1920,"height":1080,"contentType":"video/mp4","fileSize":232957525},{"url":"https://prod-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/v1/eus002/faeefb2c-8afe-45f9-bf69-1e9f8c353ed0/b2b46518-b295-4199-b02f-f0f8a341e9e3_3400.mp4","width":1280,"height":720,"contentType":"video/mp4","fileSize":122467590},{"url":"https://prod-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/v1/eus002/faeefb2c-8afe-45f9-bf69-1e9f8c353ed0/b2b46518-b295-4199-b02f-f0f8a341e9e3_2250.mp4","width":960,"height":540,"contentType":"video/mp4","fileSize":83483724},{"url":"https://prod-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/v1/eus002/faeefb2c-8afe-45f9-bf69-1e9f8c353ed0/b2b46518-b295-4199-b02f-f0f8a341e9e3_1500.mp4","width":960,"height":540,"contentType":"video/mp4","fileSize":56781196},{"url":"https://prod-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/v1/eus002/faeefb2c-8afe-45f9-bf69-1e9f8c353ed0/b2b46518-b295-4199-b02f-f0f8a341e9e3_650.mp4","width":640,"height":360,"contentType":"video/mp4","fileSize":26902993}],"dedupeIds":{"newsClusterV5HPHash":["546833357"],"newsClusterV6Hash":["-43101756"],"newsClusterV7Hash":["-2012254104"],"contentId":["AA1RkSrA"]}},{"id":"AA1QA2TG","type":"article","title":"Cognizant starts tracking employees’ laptop and website activity on select projects","abstract":"Cognizant Technology Solutions has begun training select executives on workforce management tools such as ProHance to track how long employees stay active on their laptops and which applications or websites they use during work hours, according to course material reported by Mint and other outlets.
