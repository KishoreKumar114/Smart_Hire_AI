The objective is clear - execute deep strikes, destroy enemy positions and capture key objectives across the western front. With Operation Sindoor still fresh, the Army Commander reminded that India had inflicted heavy damage earlier and is fully prepared to do so again if provoked. Against the backdrop of rugged Himalayan terrain and cutting-edge battlefield technology, the Army’s message is unmistakable.
