Experts say the shift corrects decades of underestimation of the central Himalayan segment, where locked faults continue accumulating stress powerful enough to generate a massive surface-rupturing earthquake. Using global PSHA standards, the updated Earthquake Design Code integrates active faults, maximum magnitudes, soil behaviour, near-fault motion and exposure-based vulnerability. As a result, 61% of India’s land is now officially under moderate to high seismic hazard. The fresh norms introduce strict requirements for buildings, focusing for the first time on non-structural failures that often cause injuries. Critical infrastructure must stay operational even after severe shaking. This map is a blueprint for survival, forcing India to confront its most dangerous natural threat.","readTimeMin":0,"url":"https://www.msn.com/en-in/news/india/india-s-updated-quake-map-warns-entire-himalayan-arc-faces-major-risk-forcing-urgent-safety-reforms/vi-AA1RkSrA","locale":"en-in","isLocalContent":false,"publishedDateTime":"2025-11-28T18:29:35Z","height":304.0,"wpoId":8,"isFeatured":false,"images":[{"width":690,"height":388,"url":"https://th.bing.com/th?id=ORMS.5cc0b7e9fe9402fadfe1948bb2324178&pid=Wdp","attribution":"","title":"India's
