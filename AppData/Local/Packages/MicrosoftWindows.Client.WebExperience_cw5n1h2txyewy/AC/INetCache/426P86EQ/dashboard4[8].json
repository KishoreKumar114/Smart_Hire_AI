He said the future will be shaped by faster weapons, robotics, autonomous platforms, massive sensor networks, and multi-domain warfare where cyber, space, and information will be as decisive as land and air. Stressing that “failure in war is catastrophic,” he said India cannot afford complacency as traditional frontlines disappear and entire national infrastructures can now be targeted. With nuclear treaties collapsing and major powers signalling new weapon developments, he warned that the world is entering dangerous territory.
