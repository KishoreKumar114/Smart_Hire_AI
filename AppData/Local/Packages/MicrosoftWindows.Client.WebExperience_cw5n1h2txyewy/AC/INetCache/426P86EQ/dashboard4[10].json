Experts say the shift corrects decades of underestimation of the central Himalayan segment, where locked faults continue accumulating stress powerful enough to generate a massive surface-rupturing earthquake. Using global PSHA standards, the updated Earthquake Design Code integrates active faults, maximum magnitudes, soil behaviour, near-fault motion and exposure-based vulnerability. As a result, 61% of India’s land is now officially under moderate to high seismic hazard. The fresh norms introduce strict requirements for buildings, focusing for the first time on non-structural failures that often cause injuries. Critical infrastructure must stay operational even after severe shaking.

Linked to the Goldy Dhillon gang, Shekhon was seized with a Chinese PX-3 pistol, revealing how Indian gang networks have penetrated a foreign crime scene. Kap’s Café suffered three attacks since July, gunfire at 4:30 am, Molotov cocktails, CCTV-captured drive-by shootings, and intimidation videos released by suspects. Claims of responsibility came from Goldy Dhillon, Kulvir Sidhu and BKI terrorist Harjeet Singh Laddi, each threatening more action and accusing Bollywood figures of “anti-religious remarks.” The gang even said Kapil did not answer their calls.
